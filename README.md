# Pokemon Recreation in Java

## Description

Welcome to the Pokemon Java Project, the culmination of our efforts in the RUG's Object Oriented Programming (AI) course 2023! We (@Jazhyc, @servantOfTheMostHigh, @StanIvanov1235, @JonaJanssen) attempted to recreate the popular video game in Java while following the OOP principles that we learned during the course. As a result, the game is quite expansive and includes many of the features that you would expect from a Pokemon game. Our adherence to design patterns also means that the game is mostly free of bugs (although there are still quite a few). For me personally, the creation of this project taught me considerably about working on semi-large-scale projects and creating well-written software. I hope you enjoy playing the game as much as we enjoyed making it!
